# Cyber Security Base 2024 - Project 1

This repo contains the code for my submission of course project for MOOC course 'Cyber Security Base' held by University of Helsinki.


The project has been given a [assignment](ASSIGNMENT.md) to guide development and reporting.


The software I've created, has a [description](APPLICATION.md) for everyone interested.


I've also written a [quick guide](COMMANDS.md) which has instructions to run the software.


And here are the direct links to [flaws](FLAWS.md) and [fixes](FIXES.md) in the software.


I've also added the OWASPs Top 10 web application security risk list as [markdown file](OWASP_TOP_TEN.md) to quickly reference.


And the [project report essay](ESSAY.md) is additionally included in this repo.
